# Electronic-signal-mixing-and-filtering
This project is a schematic design of and electronic circuit to generate two audio signals one in upper mid range frequency and the other is one sixth of the frequency of the first signal. The circuit then mixed the two signals and filters them back using high pass and low pass filtering circuits.
